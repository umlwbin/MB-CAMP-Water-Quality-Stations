Provincial samples were collected between <b>May 24,1973 and August 14,2018 </b>. CAMP samples are the blue dots and represent from the start of the program in <b>2008 until Dec. 31, 2024.</b> <br><br>
           You can toggle off and on layers to view all sample locations for the dataset by clicking on them in the map legend. Select start and end dates from the boxes at the bottom of the map if you want a specific date range. <br><br>
           For the provincial dataset, sample locations are divided into less than or greater than 2 years. <br><br>
